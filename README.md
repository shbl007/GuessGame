# GuessGame Using React Native
**Description**:

GuessGame is an interactive mobile application developed using React Native, aimed at challenging users' logical reasoning skills and intuition. Developed using React Native, the application ensures cross-platform compatibility and optimal performance. GuessGame invites players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. GuessGame exemplifies the fusion of React Native's versatility, Expo's convenience, and Expo Go's real-time testing capabilities, delivering an immersive and entertaining gaming experience. With its intuitive interface, engaging gameplay mechanics, and robust error handling.

**Game Features**:

- **Engaging Gameplay**: In GuessGame, players are tasked with guessing a secret number chosen by the opponent (the game) within the range of 1 to 100. The opponent makes guesses based on user feedback, aiming to identify the secret number in minimal attempts.

- **User Interaction**: The game interface comprises three screens:

  - **StartGameScreen**: Allows users to input their chosen number to start the game.
  
  - **GameScreen**: Displays the ongoing game, where users can provide feedback to the opponent's guesses using intuitive buttons labeled "+" and "-", indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the secret number.
  
  - **GameOverScreen**: Presents the outcome of the game, showcasing the total number of guesses made by the opponent and the final guessed number.
  
- **Additional Feature - Error Handling**: GuessGame incorporates an advanced error handling mechanism to enhance user experience. If a player mistakenly provides incorrect feedback by pressing "+" or "-" when the actual relationship between the guessed number and the secret number is different, a warning popup alerts the user, preventing unintended actions and ensuring a smoother gameplay experience.
