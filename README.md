**Game Features**:

**Engaging Gameplay**: In GuessGame, players are tasked with guessing a secret number chosen by the opponent (the game) within the range of 1 to 100. The opponent makes guesses based on user feedback, aiming to identify the secret number in minimal attempts.

**User Interaction**: The game interface comprises three screens:

  -**StartGameScreen**: Allows users to input their chosen number to start the game.
  -**GameScreen**: Displays the ongoing game, where users can provide feedback to the opponent's guesses using intuitive buttons labeled "+" and "-", indicating whether the guessed number     is higher or lower than the secret number.
  -**GameOverScreen**: Presents the outcome of the game, showcasing the total number of guesses made by the opponent and the final guessed number.
  
**Additional Feature** - Error Handling: GuessGame incorporates an advanced error handling mechanism to enhance user experience. If a player mistakenly provides incorrect feedback by pressing "+" or "-" when the actual relationship between the guessed number and the secret number is different, a warning popup alerts the user, preventing unintended actions and ensuring a smoother gameplay experience.
